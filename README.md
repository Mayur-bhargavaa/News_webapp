Architecture

The Express News App follows a client-server architecture:

Frontend (Client): The frontend is built using React, leveraging components for modularity. The app allows users to select interests, view news articles, and interact with them.

Backend (Server): The backend is developed using Node.js and Express. It handles user authentication, interacts with the MongoDB database, and provides endpoints for saving and fetching articles.

Database: The MongoDB database stores user data, articles, and interactions.

Design Decisions
Technology Stack: React was chosen for the frontend due to its component-based structure and fast rendering capabilities. Node.js and Express were selected for the backend for their performance and flexibility. MongoDB was chosen as the database for its scalability and ease of use.

User Authentication: JWT-based authentication is implemented for secure user registration, login, and article saving.

Data Fetching: The app fetches news articles using the NewsAPI, enhancing the user experience with up-to-date content.

User Interactions: Users can save articles, which are stored in the database, and receive personalized recommendations based on their interactions.

Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

Toast Notifications: React Toastify is used to display user-friendly notifications for actions such as saving articles or login/logout.

Future Improvements
Implement social sharing features for articles.
Enhance the recommendation system using machine learning algorithms.
Add more customization options for user profiles.
Implement real-time updates for saved articles.
Enhance accessibility and optimize performance.
